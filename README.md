App Title: Skate Spotter

This app is designed to allow skateboarders to share skateboard spots, whether it be a handrail, set of stairs, or ledge for example, with the rest of the skateboard community, . This way, when someone is in a new city and looking to get their shred on, they can simply open Skate Spotter and check for spots.


Technologies Used:

This app was created with the MERN-stack (MongoDB/Mongoose, Express, React, Node), and uses AJAX for communication between front and backend. It also uses token-based authentication.


Getting Started:

The app is deployed to Heroku and can be found at this link: https://blooming-wildwood-28468.herokuapp.com/spots

The trello board that was used can be found here: https://trello.com/b/mF8w075m/project-2


Next Steps/Icebox Items:

Adding image upload functionality, along with browser based geolocation for each skateboard spot. Improvements to styling are needed as well, along with the ability to search and filter skateboard spots by location.
